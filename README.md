# Ising-model
Ising-model to predict the sequence dependent destabilization of double-stranded DNA



The mcm_ising.py file can be used to predict melting probabilities for double-stranded DNA under standard conditions. The function melting_prob needs to be called, with the sequence as input.

The mcm_ising_struc.py file can be used to predict melting probabilites for double-stranded DNA under given twist-stress (defined by 'twists'-array), by calling the melting_prob function.
